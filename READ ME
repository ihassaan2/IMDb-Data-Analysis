Here I've ingested  data in Excel Pivot tables and performed ETL to remove outliers, clean up bad records, normalize revenue numbers by using advanced
formatting options. 
•Found the most profitable movies by genre and country by creating custom fields which calculated the net profit
•Created custom field for profit margins calculations and displayed this in a simplified line chart etc.
•Used Excel Charts to build various visualizations and a dashboard that showed interesting insights into the data.
